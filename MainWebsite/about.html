    <h3>🌍 Our Origin</h3>
    <p>
      So our company was founded in 2023 in Camberwell, London by a man called Josh Scott. 
      He was extremely frustrated with how most of the software he uses lacks accessibility 
      options as he has vision impairment and the fact that a lot of websites are way too difficult
      to use. Since it was getting ridiculous for him he decided to handle these issues himself by 
      making this company that is dedicated to make sure more people can use devices more easily
