        <h3>Week 01</h3>
        <p>In week 1 we explored how user interfaces worked in the 90s in comparison 
          to now to see how far software has developed over the years from its style, 
          features and a lot more. We have analysed a decent amount of websites and analysed 
          the: what is the software, is it user friendly? and why does this website exist?. 
          There is a lot to keep in mind when taking inspiration from other software's.</p>

        <h3>Week 02</h3>
        <p>Week 2 is about making a portfolio website telling visitors about who we are, 
          what are our skills and what our passion is. Its also about learning how to use 
          CSS where w3schools shows us and tests us about our knowledge of CSS which will be 
          incredibly useful when it comes to coding. Alongside that we also gathered terms 
          used in the world wide web development and gathered those into a glossary.</p>

        <h3>Week 03</h3>
        <p>In week 3 that is when we start going in depth with coding, we used programming 
          languages like CSS and Html we attempted to make self portraits because we wanted 
          to test if we can mess around with visuals which can be useful in development. 
          Alongside that we also wrote down plans and explanations about our website such as: 
          who is our target audience, how can we implement user friendly features like accessibility options?</p>

        <h3>Week 04</h3>
        <p>Moving on to week 4 this is where we are sketching out and practising website 
          designs like this one here using a software called Figma, the final website in 
          our development will be taking heavy inspiration from this but due to the software 
          limitations of Figma some or a lot of things here could be subject to change. </p>

        <h3>Week 05 – UI/UX Design</h3>
        <p>
          Now for week 5 we are practising adding accessibility options here, we are adding the basics 
          like light/dark mode so those with eye issues can activate dark mode as that should make things
          easier on the eyes. This is still continuing on Figma. Also for those who lack hand mobility we 
          are making the web buttons bigger so less precision is required.

        <h3>Week 06</h3>
        <p>JavaScript was the centre of attention in week 6 where using that programming language we 
          would create another practice webpage that involves diffract animations such as: displaying 
          text as its being types out to stimulate typing effects, having buttons become bigger and 
          change shade when being hovered or clicked and having assets move away from the mouse in smart animations.</p>

        <h3>Week 08</h3>
        <p>So week 7 was our week off so we’re moving onto week 8. Continuing with JavaScript 
          were now focusing on interactivity with buttons where clicking buttons will obviously 
          change the website. For example we made a simple version of the light/dark mode trigger 
          where if you click 1 button it changes the background colour whereas the other button makes 
          the background white again. We also design a playful silly concept where we would make the most 
          annoying website with stuff like: delayed presses, annoying “im not a robot” quizzes, big constant pop-ups, etc.</p>

      <div class="work-info">
        <h3>Week 09</h3>
        <p>With Html were now learning with GSAP where we can add more fluid animations to our 
          actual website including things like “ScrollTrigger” which will make animations happen 
          as you scroll through the website as we commonly see Apple’s website use for example. 
          To test GSAP we first got a box and added interactive buttons to control its movement 
          and after that we used GSAP to make it animate so it wasn't clipping all other the place.</p>

        <h3>Week 10</h3>
        <p>Week 10 is where we learn to connect our computers to the CCI servers alongside that 
          we are now also working with Node.js, npm and vite. Node.js provides the environment, 
          npm manages the materials, and Vite is the specialized machine that builds the final product. 
          Using these I added a confetti affect for when the user clicks the screen.</p>
