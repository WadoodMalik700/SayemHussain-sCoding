# Sayem Hussain's Coding 3 Documention
## Week 1
### Task 1
For the very first task, using Html and css I made a short and simple 1 paged website which gives a short introduction to who I am as this is a short and simple portfolio. This was mainly me practacting and testing out diffrant layouts and colours to try and make something simplistic. So by using CSS I was about to choose which colours I wanted for each sections which i divided using the "section", "head", etc functions so that each assest was more eye catching and hard to miss and also it allowed me to distance each section from each other to make the webpage more clean without any overlapping.

### Task 2
Next up for task 2 I took what I made from task 1 but tried to make some improments to it by laying it out a lot better by putting a gray box around the "about me section" using CSS to make navigation slightly easier alongside adding an image as a portfolio does require an image. It may be a picture of a blank person but it shows the idea of the layout I was going for. Using this website: https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/how-to-include-images-in-html-with-visual-studio-code - I was able to learn about the "img" function because for my main website this funcation was going to be very useful.

## Week 2
### Task 1
With week 2 I made some improvments to the week 1 code onto it but there was some things I wanted to change:
* What if i added a link function so that html and css can be in sepreate pages which would make the code look a lot neater.
* If I added a bit on interactivity so when you hover the mouse over the image it makes the image size increase a little bit.

So on the repository you can see the current verions of week 1's tasks have the link function because originally I did have html and css on the same page but it looked too messy so I added a link function to fix that. Then with week 2 I made a basic layout which involves having a: Heading, subheading, paragraph and an image. Thne on css I used cursor and transition functions so that the mouse hover caused the assest (image) to slightly increase in size when being hovered upon. I used this webstie for help: https://success.appen.com/hc/en-us/articles/202703155-CSS-Guide-to-Enlarge-Images-on-Hover

### Task 2
Now with task 2 we're moving away from the mini portfolio website to make somethine else: by making multiple html document codes in 1 folder I am able to have a website with multiple web pages. So I decided to make a webstie that redirects from one page to another in an infinate loop where every few seconds the web pages are constanly switching. This was more of an expermental task but for me it was about learning how to link multiple html pages together so that I can also include a button on each page so the user can switch pages manually if they want. "meta http-equiv="refresh"" causes ythe websites to automatically redirect from one to another and "a href="page2.html">Go to Page 2/a" is the function that adds a manual interactive button because interactive on websties is essential whcih was why I wanted to test it with this task. I did use AI (ChatGPT) for the "href" feature as I was stuggling to create the loop myself.
