# Sayem Hussain's Coding 3 Documention
## Week 1
### Task 1
For the very first task, using Html and css I made a short and simple 1 paged website which gives a short introduction to who I am as this is a short and simple portfolio. This was mainly me practacting and testing out diffrant layouts and colours to try and make something simplistic. So by using CSS I was about to choose which colours I wanted for each sections which i divided using the "section", "head", etc functions so that each assest was more eye catching and hard to miss and also it allowed me to distance each section from each other to make the webpage more clean without any overlapping.

### Task 2
Next up for task 2 I took what I made from task 1 but tried to make some improments to it by laying it out a lot better by putting a gray box around the "about me section" using CSS to make navigation slightly easier alongside adding an image as a portfolio does require an image. It may be a picture of a blank person but it shows the idea of the layout I was going for. Using this website: https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/how-to-include-images-in-html-with-visual-studio-code - I was able to learn about the "img" function because for my main website this funcation was going to be very useful.

## Week 2
### Task 1
With week 2 I made some improvments to the week 1 code onto it but there was some things I wanted to change:
* What if i added a link function so that html and css can be in sepreate pages which would make the code look a lot neater.
* If I added a bit on interactivity so when you hover the mouse over the image it makes the image size increase a little bit.

So on the repository you can see the current verions of week 1's tasks have the link function because originally I did have html and css on the same page but it looked too messy so I added a link function to fix that. Then with week 2 I made a basic layout which involves having a: Heading, subheading, paragraph and an image. Thne on css I used cursor and transition functions so that the mouse hover caused the assest (image) to slightly increase in size when being hovered upon. I used this webstie for help: https://success.appen.com/hc/en-us/articles/202703155-CSS-Guide-to-Enlarge-Images-on-Hover

### Task 2
Now with task 2 we're moving away from the mini portfolio website to make somethine else: by making multiple html document codes in 1 folder I am able to have a website with multiple web pages. So I decided to make a webstie that redirects from one page to another in an infinate loop where every few seconds the web pages are constanly switching. This was more of an expermental task but for me it was about learning how to link multiple html pages together so that I can also include a button on each page so the user can switch pages manually if they want. "meta http-equiv="refresh"" causes ythe websites to automatically redirect from one to another and "a href="page2.html">Go to Page 2/a" is the function that adds a manual interactive button because interactive on websties is essential whcih was why I wanted to test it with this task. I did use AI (ChatGPT) for the "href" feature as I was stuggling to create the loop myself.

DESCLAIMER: I did attempt to upload a video of it but this document doesn't allow me to upload videos

## Week 3
### Task 1
For the 1 task I did for week 3 I had to combine diffrant shapes and colours to make a face that looks like a human - like a portrait. Using this website: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_circles.asp - I was able to learn about how to draw shapes, this was important as for my main website I planned on making shapes in the form of large clickable buttons for better accessilibity. With this code CSS did most of the heavy lifting with the positioning of everything alongside the use of diffrant colours so that every aspect of the face was visible.

## Week 4
### Task 1
Week 4s tasks involved choosing an idea from this website: https://www.are.na/ian-mcdonald/an-idea-for-a-website - and choosing which one we wanted to make, they had some really interesting options like:
* A haunted website
* A time limtied website

And a lot more, I chose to make an animated lavalamp and by using the help of: https://dev.to/eidorianavi/an-introduction-to-animation-and-keyframes-in-css-30mi#:~:text=To%20build%20out%20a%20keyframe,re%20animation%20should%20be%20doing. - I was able to learn about the @keyframes function whcih allowed the lava (which were just a bunch of orange circles mashed together) to change sizes randomly. CSS was about programming each "lava" piece's behaviour such has how long it should take to transition to another size or what sizes should it change to. Then I used html to display everything.

## Week 5
### Task 1
Week 5 was mainly about using Figma to put together a user interface that you'd probably want to use on the main website so i used it to easily drag around diffrant assets and experiment with diffrant colours without worrying about any coding. I used a prototype option a lot to be able to link many webpages together to create an interative webpage alongside constanly creating componants and combing them as variants so i can do cool stuff such as: 
* Create an outline whenever the mouse is hovered over somethine
* Have assets change colour based on the users actions
* Have a dark/light mode trigger

And so much more! This was more about preperation so when it came to acctually coding the website I have something I can work with in terms of design and layout.

## Week 6
### Task 1
Now alongsid html and css we're also including javascript onto our code, Javascript adds more interactivity and functionality to our codes so unlike week 2 which only had a link button with this task I made it so when you press the button it displays a piece of text where each letter is a diffrant colour everytime you push the button. So on javascript I used funtions like TypeWriter and RandomColour so not only does the text have random colours but it has a little typing animation as well. This website gave a good idea on how to get a started with the TypeWriter function this did help me a bit: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_typewriter.asp

### Task 2
Unfortunaly I wasnt able to get this code running how I'd like but what I tried to do was make a unqiue weather app that shows the time but also have rain effects in the background that would fill up the website with water overtime the longer the website was open for. So using getWeather function I tried to make it so that it would show the celcius but I was only able to get the 24-hour clock working using the getClock function. I unfortuanly also had to use AI (ChatGPT) for the dynamic background where it would fill up with water because I didn't really understand javascript that much at the time. But with the clock I used this video to give me a good idea of how to put together a clock: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vNExSvvBOE - as for the rain I mainly focased on using "random" functions on x and y axis to randomly determain where each rain drop should apprear so therefore the shapes can apprear all over the document giving the illusion of rain.
