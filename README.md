# Sayem Hussain's Coding 3 Documention
## Week 1
### Task 1
For the very first task, using Html and css I made a short and simple 1 paged website which gives a short introduction to who I am as this is a short and simple portfolio. This was mainly me practacting and testing out diffrant layouts and colours to try and make something simplistic. So by using CSS I was about to choose which colours I wanted for each sections which i divided using the "section", "head", etc functions so that each assest was more eye catching and hard to miss and also it allowed me to distance each section from each other to make the webpage more clean without any overlapping.

### Task 2
Next up for task 2 I took what I made from task 1 but tried to make some improments to it by laying it out a lot better by putting a gray box around the "about me section" using CSS to make navigation slightly easier alongside adding an image as a portfolio does require an image. It may be a picture of a blank person but it shows the idea of the layout I was going for. Using this website: https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/how-to-include-images-in-html-with-visual-studio-code - I was able to learn about the "img" function because for my main website this funcation was going to be very useful.
