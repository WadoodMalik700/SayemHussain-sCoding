# Sayem Hussain's Coding 3 Documention
## Week 1
### Task 1
For the very first task, using Html and css I made a short and simple 1 paged website which gives a short introduction to who I am as this is a short and simple portfolio. This was mainly me practacting and testing out diffrant layouts and colours to try and make something simplistic. So by using CSS I was about to choose which colours I wanted for each sections which i divided using the "section", "head", etc functions so that each assest was more eye catching and hard to miss and also it allowed me to distance each section from each other to make the webpage more clean without any overlapping.

### Task 2
Next up for task 2 I took what I made from task 1 but tried to make some improments to it by laying it out a lot better by putting a gray box around the "about me section" using CSS to make navigation slightly easier alongside adding an image as a portfolio does require an image. It may be a picture of a blank person but it shows the idea of the layout I was going for. Using this website: https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/how-to-include-images-in-html-with-visual-studio-code - I was able to learn about the "img" function because for my main website this funcation was going to be very useful.

<img width="300" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81d18721-beb7-4299-aa87-57342e340f45" />

## Week 2
### Task 1
With week 2 I made some improvments to the week 1 code onto it but there was some things I wanted to change:
* What if i added a link function so that html and css can be in sepreate pages which would make the code look a lot neater.
* If I added a bit on interactivity so when you hover the mouse over the image it makes the image size increase a little bit.

So on the repository you can see the current verions of week 1's tasks have the link function because originally I did have html and css on the same page but it looked too messy so I added a link function to fix that. Then with week 2 I made a basic layout which involves having a: Heading, subheading, paragraph and an image. Thne on css I used cursor and transition functions so that the mouse hover caused the assest (image) to slightly increase in size when being hovered upon. I used this webstie for help: https://success.appen.com/hc/en-us/articles/202703155-CSS-Guide-to-Enlarge-Images-on-Hover

<img width="500" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f95e86fc-2496-4a18-8a68-73d1f947b1c3" />

### Task 2
Now with task 2 we're moving away from the mini portfolio website to make somethine else: by making multiple html document codes in 1 folder I am able to have a website with multiple web pages. So I decided to make a webstie that redirects from one page to another in an infinate loop where every few seconds the web pages are constanly switching. This was more of an expermental task but for me it was about learning how to link multiple html pages together so that I can also include a button on each page so the user can switch pages manually if they want. "meta http-equiv="refresh"" causes ythe websites to automatically redirect from one to another and "a href="page2.html">Go to Page 2/a" is the function that adds a manual interactive button because interactive on websties is essential whcih was why I wanted to test it with this task. I did use AI (ChatGPT) for the "href" feature as I was stuggling to create the loop myself.

DESCLAIMER: I did attempt to upload a video of it but this document doesn't allow me to upload videos

## Week 3
### Task 1
For the 1 task I did for week 3 I had to combine diffrant shapes and colours to make a face that looks like a human - like a portrait. Using this website: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_circles.asp - I was able to learn about how to draw shapes, this was important as for my main website I planned on making shapes in the form of large clickable buttons for better accessilibity. With this code CSS did most of the heavy lifting with the positioning of everything alongside the use of diffrant colours so that every aspect of the face was visible. 

<img width="200" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04bc1aa3-5e08-473d-93f1-e0c154ea310c" />

## Week 4
### Task 1
Week 4s tasks involved choosing an idea from this website: https://www.are.na/ian-mcdonald/an-idea-for-a-website - and choosing which one we wanted to make, they had some really interesting options like:
* A haunted website
* A time limtied website

And a lot more, I chose to make an animated lavalamp and by using the help of: https://dev.to/eidorianavi/an-introduction-to-animation-and-keyframes-in-css-30mi#:~:text=To%20build%20out%20a%20keyframe,re%20animation%20should%20be%20doing. - I was able to learn about the @keyframes function whcih allowed the lava (which were just a bunch of orange circles mashed together) to change sizes randomly. CSS was about programming each "lava" piece's behaviour such has how long it should take to transition to another size or what sizes should it change to. Then I used html to display everything. 

<img width="200" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bde5393-bce2-4987-84dd-c1fd05d12210" />

## Week 5
### Task 1
Week 5 was mainly about using Figma to put together a user interface that you'd probably want to use on the main website so i used it to easily drag around diffrant assets and experiment with diffrant colours without worrying about any coding. I used a prototype option a lot to be able to link many webpages together to create an interative webpage alongside constanly creating componants and combing them as variants so i can do cool stuff such as: 
* Create an outline whenever the mouse is hovered over somethine
* Have assets change colour based on the users actions
* Have a dark/light mode trigger

And so much more! This was more about preperation so when it came to acctually coding the website I have something I can work with in terms of design and layout.

## Week 6
### Task 1
Now alongsid html and css we're also including javascript onto our code, Javascript adds more interactivity and functionality to our codes so unlike week 2 which only had a link button with this task I made it so when you press the button it displays a piece of text where each letter is a diffrant colour everytime you push the button. So on javascript I used funtions like TypeWriter and RandomColour so not only does the text have random colours but it has a little typing animation as well. This website gave a good idea on how to get a started with the TypeWriter function this did help me a bit: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_typewriter.asp

<img width="500" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b91a1980-96d9-447d-ab64-43ed6395082c" />

### Task 2
Unfortunaly I wasnt able to get this code running how I'd like but what I tried to do was make a unqiue weather app that shows the time but also have rain effects in the background that would fill up the website with water overtime the longer the website was open for. So using getWeather function I tried to make it so that it would show the celcius but I was only able to get the 24-hour clock working using the getClock function. I unfortuanly also had to use AI (ChatGPT) for the dynamic background where it would fill up with water because I didn't really understand javascript that much at the time. But with the clock I used this video to give me a good idea of how to put together a clock: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vNExSvvBOE - as for the rain I mainly focased on using "random" functions on x and y axis to randomly determain where each rain drop should apprear so therefore the shapes can apprear all over the document giving the illusion of rain.

## Week 8
### Task 1
This was kind of a funny mini website I was working on because I wanted to showcase some annoying user interface designs. So what I have done for this page is I made it so you could not press any of the buttons because whenever you try to hover accross any of the buttons I used the random function on the x and y-axies on the buttons to move them to a random place whenever the cursor is hovered accross it. Just to annoy the user even more I used Math.random on the fontSize function to make the tital of the website so big and small which can be distracting, alongside that i placed annoying messages accross the website to really annoy the user. I used this website to help me use the Math.random function: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random 

<img width="700" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e1e1baa-e972-4f88-a0fe-a3a283d77367" />

### Task 2
Moving on to task 2 this one was more about the user pushing a button in order to chnage the background, this task was more or less learning how we could implement dark mode onto our websites because the change of colour of the background is going to impact the theme a lot as the majaority of the user's screen is the background. So we have 2 buttons "activate" and "deactivate" the activate button chnages the backgroun colour to a diffrant colour meanwhile the deactivate button makes the background white again.

## Week 9
### Task 1
Controlling a direction a shape is moving in is what we had to do fro our first task, so i made four buttons that go the 4 diffrant diractions and based on which button the user clicks itll make the shape move slightly in that direction. In order to get the controls working I had to:
* Use moveBox functions with directions to make sure the shape only moved when the direction was clicked.
* Set a limit to how far the shape moved so it wouldn't go out of bounds by using "if" functions and "posX" and "posY" to tell the code the shape has gone far enough.
<img width="400" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/460fa722-b51a-4d65-9a72-e80ab1decc93" />

### Task 2
So I wanted to build upon what I made with task 1 so by implementing this line of code: "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.3/gsap.min.js" in script i was able to implement the GSAP libary which would allow me to make some nice and fluid looking animations. So i made it so that when the user clicks any direction of button not only will it move in that direction but now it will laos grow in size but go back to its normal size when the shape stops moving all in 1 animation. Using javascript i was able to set what animation I wanted alongside the duriation of the animation. Alongside that I decided to make the buttons black so that it contrasts well and the buttons are easier to see as I want to make sure for the main website I make the important features be more eye catching using diffrant colours.

## Week 10
### Task 1
The main focas for week 10 was having to connect to the cci libary so that you can have access to exclusive libaries in that server but that aside with the code I've done its an interactive animation with confetii where there would be confetti coming out of the mouse cursor but based on the location on the mouse it would change the colour of the confetti. When it comes to the coding itself I first added a gravity function so that when the confetti spawns in it falls towards the ground and I brought back the Math.random function so I can have the confettiy go in random directions when it comes out of the mouse cursor and having a lot spwan in at once will create the apperance of making all these small shapes look like confetti. Alongside that with the UpdateConetty funcation that causes the confetty to change itself while the code is running like for example using "MouseX" and "MouseY" the code can see the coordiates of the mouse cursor to change the colkour of the confetty based on where the cursor itself is. DESCLAIMER: I did use Ai to help me make the gravity function as I was struggling to get that to work.

<img width="100" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84c2387a-5f41-4aa5-9010-6b2f34104a2b" />

### Main website
Now its time to talk about the main website, to get started accessiblity was the huge main focas as I wanted as many clients to be able to use the website as possible regardless of what limitations they have. So first of all we have:
* Diffrant font size options so that if any users sturggle to read smaller text they can choose to make the size "large" or "Extra large".
* Dark mode in case anyone gets eye stain from the regular mode.
* Keyboard navigation mode will highlight where the mouse is in case the user stuggles to find the cursor.
* And larger clickable buttons so a lot less presicion is required to navigate the website.

<img width="600" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbf31bad-3a01-4724-b615-bfc3a2cdf357" />

Moving on to the homepage there isnt really anything special on there besides some scroll trigger animations alongside having componants go bigger in size and have a nice glowing effect whenever the mouse cursor hovers above it. More or less the homepage is just welcomeing the user to the website. 

<img width="600" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5ccba56-d8b8-4a52-aef5-aa71a67f391d" />

The "about" page is more or less a portfolio for an imaginary group called "the coders", where the clients can learn more about this group if they're interested. 

<img width="600" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45154b11-6612-4b42-ac33-b786b6f51108" />

Now for the "book" page I implemented a form in case clients want to book an appoinment with one of our employess (its not a real buisness) and the form asks for some basic deatails of what theyre after and after submitting all the information the webpage displays a thank you message which confirms to the user that the request has been sent over.

<img width="600" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0f29a80-5be5-4fe3-b48e-77616bb6bc6e" />

<img width="600" height="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2304db8e-e18c-4819-ac58-7bafa7d6de73" />

Now you may have seen in the screenshots we also have a button that toggles mobile view and you can use the same button to switch back to desktop mode if thats what you prefer, this button more or less changes the layout of the webpages to accomidate to mobile users.

<img width="600" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c480adb6-745a-4e98-b438-19245d0166ef" />

And for our last webpage we have the one that displays all of my weekly tasks in the "work" page, the purpose of it is to show clients the type of stuff we have made in the past and if they like what they see then they can book an appoinment with us. This website shows a little preview of the code running but we also have a button just below the preview that allows you to open a full page to see the code running better (I did try to implement a back buttong for then the code is running full screen but unfortunalty I could not get it working). ALongside that I wrote down a desciption (the desciption doesn't match the code because I copied and pasted it from another project, however everything else works the way it should). 

<img width="600" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b41696e-c93f-4f86-9678-12493a825457" />

Now when it comes to functions I have used we got:
* revealonScroll which allows for scroll trigger animations.
* fontSizeSelect.value which allowed me to add diffrant values to how big the font size should be for each option.
* settings.dark and darkToggle.onchange which allows for dark mode witht he help of selecting the right html colours on css.
* getElementById and applySettings this was so that when the user chooses an accessilibty option it applies to all webpages.
* .glow:hover is a css function that allowed me to add the glow effect when the mouse hovered over something.
* iframe is a html function that allows me to show a preview of other codes, all I had to do after that was add the folder with the codes to the main website and add the link.

Here's some of the links to websites that helped me:
https://www.miketoft.com/blog/dark-mode-for-website/ - for dark mode
https://codersblock.com/blog/creating-glow-effects-with-css/ - this helped me get started on learning about glow effects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sbtsxt9NbV8 - this video helped me learn about the iframe function.
https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/contact-form-js-thank-you-message/549398/6 - here I learnt about how I can inplement a form in the "book" page.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48685991/how-to-animate-an-element-when-scrolled-and-reveals - for scrolling animations
When it comes to the ability to change the font size I did use chatgpt to help me make the list of options for font sizez and for that to be applied to all webpages when selected.
