# Sayem Hussain's Coding 3 Documention
## Week 1
### Task 1
For the very first task, using Html and css I made a short and simple 1 paged website which gives a short introduction to who I am as this is a short and simple portfolio. This was mainly me practacting and testing out diffrant layouts and colours to try and make something simplistic. So by using CSS I was about to choose which colours I wanted for each sections which i divided using the "section", "head", etc functions so that each assest was more eye catching and hard to miss and also it allowed me to distance each section from each other to make the webpage more clean without any overlapping.

### Task 2
Next up for task 2 I took what I made from task 1 but tried to make some improments to it by laying it out a lot better by putting a gray box around the "about me section" using CSS to make navigation slightly easier alongside adding an image as a portfolio does require an image. It may be a picture of a blank person but it shows the idea of the layout I was going for. Using this website: https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/how-to-include-images-in-html-with-visual-studio-code - I was able to learn about the "img" function because for my main website this funcation was going to be very useful.

## Week 2
### Task 1
With week 2 I made some improvments to the week 1 code onto it but there was some things I wanted to change:
* What if i added a link function so that html and css can be in sepreate pages which would make the code look a lot neater.
* If I added a bit on interactivity so when you hover the mouse over the image it makes the image size increase a little bit.

So on the repository you can see the current verions of week 1's tasks have the link function because originally I did have html and css on the same page but it looked too messy so I added a link function to fix that. Then with week 2 I made a basic layout which involves having a: Heading, subheading, paragraph and an image. Thne on css I used cursor and transition functions so that the mouse hover caused the assest (image) to slightly increase in size when being hovered upon. I used this webstie for help: https://success.appen.com/hc/en-us/articles/202703155-CSS-Guide-to-Enlarge-Images-on-Hover
